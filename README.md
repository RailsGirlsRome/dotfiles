Description
-----------

This repo contains the `rc` files that make up the
customized ruby & rails console, with lots of hearts
and a clearer exception printer.

Requirements
------------

Install the following gems:

* `pry`
* `pry-doc`
* `pry-rails`
* `hirb`
* `awesome\_print`

Install
-------

* `git clone` this repo into your `~/.railsgirls`
* Run `~/.railsgirls/setup`

If you see hearts, it worked.

Caveats
-------

This installs `~/.pryrc`, `~/.railsrc`, `~/.rails.tpl` and
Git configurations - so as you may already have these files
with your customizations, your best bet is to create another
user on your machine.
